# Project 3
For this project, you will partially implement a Dictionary ADT with extra functionality of being able to find the closest entries in the dictionary to the given invalid word. 
You will partially implement such a dictionary using a compact prefix tree. Please see a project description and a link for the starter code on Canvas.
